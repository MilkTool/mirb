SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings taints the result of interpolation when an interpolated value is tainted
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings untrusts the result of interpolation when an interpolated value is untrusted
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings backslashes follow the same rules as interpolation
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings allow HEREDOC with <<identifier, interpolated
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings allow HEREDOC with <<"identifier", interpolated
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings allow HEREDOC with <<'identifier', no interpolation
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings allow HEREDOC with <<-identifier, allowing to indent identifier, interpolated
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings allow HEREDOC with <<-"identifier", allowing to indent identifier, interpolated
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings allow HEREDOC with <<-'identifier', allowing to indent identifier, no interpolation
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings call #to_s when the object is not a String
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings call #to_s as a private method
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings uses an internal representation when #to_s doesn't return a String
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings are produced from control character shortcuts
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings Unicode escaping can be done with \\u and four hex digits
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings Unicode escaping can be done with \\u{} and one to six hex digits
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings Unicode escaping with US-ASCII source encoding produces an ASCII string when escaping ASCII characters via \\u
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings Unicode escaping with US-ASCII source encoding produces an ASCII string when escaping ASCII characters via \\u{}
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings Unicode escaping with US-ASCII source encoding produces a UTF-8-encoded string when escaping non-ASCII characters via \\u
SpecTag:fails::Ruby character strings Unicode escaping with US-ASCII source encoding produces a UTF-8-encoded string when escaping non-ASCII characters via \\u{}
